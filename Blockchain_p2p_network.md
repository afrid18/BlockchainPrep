- #### P2P Network has five layers associated with it

    1. Consenses Layer
    2. Miner Layer
    3. Propagation Layer
    4. Semantic Layer
    5. Application Layer


1. #### Consenses Layer:
        A consensus mechanism is an agreement needed for the network to operate properly even in the event of a failure. it needs to be able to achieve agreement on the data of the network within the distributed p2p network.
